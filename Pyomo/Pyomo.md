#Pyomo

Pyomo is a Python-based open-source modelling language to solve Optimization Problems

Pyomo is used to model various structures optimization applications.

Pyomo can be linked with many open-source and commercial solvers to solve the problems modelled.

Pyomo has seemless integration with solvers like CPLEX, GUROBI etc.

Pyomo supports a wide range of problem types:

*	Linear programming
*	Quadratic programming
*	Nonlinear programming
*	Mixed-integer linear programming
*	Mixed-integer quadratic programming
*	Mixed-integer nonlinear programming
*	Stochastic programming
*	Generalized disjunctive programming
*	Differential algebraic equations
*	Bilevel programming
*	Mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints

Pyomo when used with another module called networkx opens up immense possibilities to model even the most complicated algorithms. Graphs problems like:

*	Shortest Path
*	Minimum SPanning Tree etc., can be easily modelled and solved using Pyomo and Networkx
